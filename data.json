are the part of the breast that is commonly used for this type of activity. pain is typically applied to them using nipple clamps, a type of sex toy which can be attached to erect nipples to pinch them and to restrict the blood flow to them by applying pressure. when nipple clamps are removed, further pain is caused by the return of normal blood flow. men's as well as women's nipples of can receive such treatment.\n\nerotic electrostimulation of the breasts is also practiced although such activity around the chest area may carry risks of electrocution.\n\npainful activities such as wax play, spanking, squeezing, punching, or flogging can also be applied to breasts/nipples.\n\nthe recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.\n\nnote that many of these practices, as with pussy torture and cock and ball torture, carry health risks.
